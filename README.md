# Privacy Taxonomy

The international taxonomy of privacy and personal data records.

## Purpose

Privacy laws and data protection matters become increasingly popular. Understanding the implications of data use and potential abuse is important for authorities, organisations, and individuals working on such matters. The authors of this document hold an extensive degree of experience in a variety of sensible data protection domains. Our intention is to provide a baseline of terms and data semantics, which should enable the community to build upon.

You are asked to join our effort and submit taxonomy data for fields where you hold experience. We are also happy to adapt the existing taxonomy and will handle all pull requests transparently. Goal of this project is the agile development of a privacy taxonomy with well coverage. At this point the project will freeze the existing taxonomy and initiate clear guidance and a strict versioning schema.
